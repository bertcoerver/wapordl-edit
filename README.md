# WaPORDL

Oringal wapordl description: Download data from the WaPOR3 dataset as spatially aggregated timeseries or as spatial data clipped to a bounding-box or shapefile.

--------------

wapordl is a great little package that provides easy access to wapor v3 data via python. Specificlaly it supports the quick and easy downloading of rasters and time series

It can be accessed via the link below as well as directly (and much mor easily) via conda or pip:

    *conda install  -c conda-forge wapordl*

If your interested in carrying out zonal statistics (calculating field based statistics) you can clone or download this repo to get access to that functionality as well.

please see the notebook: *tutorial\wapor_zonalstats.ipynb* for details

--------------

Again all credits go to Bert Coever and the FAO for building a great package. This repo thus builds on the work of Bert Coever and the FAO.

If you do not need zonal statistics I reccomend utilising the original wapordl repo via conda as it is a much easier install
